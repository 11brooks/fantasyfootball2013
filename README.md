##The Draft
 
###Date/Time: August 18th, 7:00PM

The draft will be a live auction draft.

Basically, you get "$200" you can use to bid on different players and "sign" them to your team. 

Before the draft, you can assign players different "draft values" or just use the values Yahoo auto-generates for you. There are many resources and "cheat sheets" for assigning value to players, and knowing how much to spend. ESPN has a pretty simple one [here](http://g.espncdn.com/s/ffldraftkit/13/NFLDK2K13_CS_Stand$.pdf?addata=2013=ffldft_chtsht_standvalues_xxx). (Note, these values will change over time depending on a large number of factors - including injuries)

On draft day, each team nominates a player for auction every round. Teams have 30 seconds to nominate a player, and then everyone gets 30 seconds to bid. If someone bids within the last 10 seconds, an additional 10 seconds is added on the clock to allow other teams to counter-bid.

This style of draft makes things much fairer overall, since you don't really have to worry about getting a bad draft position, but instead can focus on strategy and managing your budget.

If you want to get a better feel for how this works, you can do a [mock draft](http://football.fantasysports.yahoo.com/f1/263499/mock_lobby?lobby=auction).

##Scoring

Our league uses "Head to Head" scoring. Each week, teams "play" each other and are scored based on a variety of metrics - including passing yards, touchdowns, and interceptions. The winning team gets a "win", which is used at the end of the season to determine which teams make the playoffs.

You can see the point breakdown on the [scoring chart](https://github.com/11brooks/fantasyfootball2013/blob/master/scoring.md).

##Playoffs

At the end of the "regular season" (13 weeks), the top 4 teams from each division will advance to the playoffs.

##FAQ

**Sweet! How do I play?**

Send an email to [paul@lettuceapps.com](mailto:paul@lettuceapps.com).

**What if I don't know how to play fantasy football?**

Don't worry. I haven't played in years, and am far from an expert on fantasy football or football in general. The point is to have fun and liven up your Sundays.

If you're still worried, here is an awesome list of [fantasy football resources](http://www.reddit.com/r/fantasyfootball/comments/1j3isn/since_now_is_the_time_of_year_everyone_starts/).

**What if I can't make the draft?**

If you can't make the draft, but still want to play, you can pre-rank your players (or just use the default ranks), and Yahoo Sports will auto-nominate and auto-bid for you.

If a large number of people can't make the draft, we can switch the date.

**Does this cost anything?**

Yep. There is a $30 entry fee.

**Where does that money go?**

50% of the pot will go to the playoff champ, 20% to 2nd place, and 30% to the regular season champ. (This is not set in stone.)

If enough people are ok with increasing the entry fee, we can do weekly prizes for most total points, bounties, or other cool stuff.

**Does this require a lot of time and effort?**

You can put as much or as little time into this as you want. At the bare minimum, you'll want to make sure that all of your "starting" players for the week are actually playing (not injured or on a bye week).
